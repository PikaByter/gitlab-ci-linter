// This command line tool use the Gitlab API to validate your local `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
// It can be installed as a git pre-commit hook, preventing commit (and so push) of an invalid `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
//
// The tool itself does not lint anything: it uses the lint API of a Gitlab instance => it needs to be run somewhere with an access to the Gitlab instance where your project come from.
//
//  Goodbye "yaml invalid" pipeline errors, and don't come back!
